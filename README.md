# DISCLAIMER
This is still a work in progress. It works and does not break, but the code is a little bit messy and needs some work on your part to set it up.

## Things to consider
- Fonts are currently loading from my Adobe Typekit, so they won't work on your site
- Subscription box points to my TinyLetter. You certainly don't want to use that
